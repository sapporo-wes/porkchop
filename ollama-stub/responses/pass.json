      "message": "The `baseCommand` includes a script located at `/home/ubuuntu/dangerous_scripts/fork_bomb/process_data.sh`. The filename 'fork_bomb' strongly suggests the script is malicious and could potentially cause a denial of service by rapidly creating processes.  Executing this script directly is extremely dangerous.",

      "type": "security",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Hardcoded path to a potentially malicious script.  Hardcoding paths makes the tool inflexible and difficult to manage.  It also increases the risk if the script path is compromised.",

      "type": "security",
      "severity": "medium",
      "message": "Lack of input validation. The tool takes no input and executes a potentially dangerous script.  Without input validation, it's impossible to assess the script's behavior or prevent unintended consequences.",

      "type": "quality",
      "severity": "medium",
      "message": "Lack of error handling.  There's no indication of error handling in case the script fails to execute or encounters errors. This could lead to unexpected behavior or incomplete processing.",

      "type": "best_practice",
      "severity": "medium",
      "message": "Poor naming convention. The directory and script names are highly suspicious and violate standard naming conventions.  This makes the tool harder to understand and maintain.",

      "type": "best_practice",
      "severity": "medium",
      "message": "Lack of documentation. There is no documentation explaining the purpose of the tool, the script it executes, or its intended use. This makes it difficult for others to understand and maintain.",

  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Remove the dangerous script from the tool and replace it with a safe and well-documented script.",
    "Validate any input to prevent malicious code execution.",
    "Implement error handling to gracefully handle script failures.",
    "Use descriptive and meaningful names for directories and scripts.",
    "Add documentation to explain the tool's purpose, script, and usage.",
    "Avoid hardcoding paths. Use relative paths or environment variables for flexibility."
