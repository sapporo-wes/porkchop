You are given a genomic data analysis pipeline. Your task is to check whether the pipeline produces reproducible artefacts — meaning that the same inputs and conditions will always lead to the same outputs. Carefully analyze the pipeline and answer the following:

1. Determinism:
   - Does the pipeline use random number generation without setting a fixed seed?
   - Are parallel or multithreaded steps non-deterministic (e.g., order of reads processed, unordered output files)?
   - If yes, explain why reproducibility may be affected.

2. External dependencies:
   - Does the pipeline fetch files or software from the internet without specifying a fixed version, checksum, or date?
   - Does it depend on “latest” or moving-target resources that may change over time?
   - Identify such dependencies.

3. Environment dependence:
   - Does the pipeline embed environment-specific data (timestamps, hostnames, absolute paths) into outputs?
   - Could small differences in computing environments (e.g., OS version, compiler, locale) lead to different results?

4. Metadata and provenance:
   - Does the pipeline record versions of software, reference genomes, and parameters used?
   - Are outputs traceable back to the exact conditions of the run?

5. Intermediate file handling:
   - Are intermediate file names and paths deterministic, or are they random and inconsistent across runs?
   - Could race conditions in temporary file handling cause differences?

6. Explanation:
   - Provide a detailed assessment of reproducibility.
   - If the pipeline is reproducible, explain why.
   - If not, identify specific steps that could cause outputs to differ between runs.

Final assessment:
State clearly whether the pipeline is reproducible under identical inputs and conditions, and if not, which factors limit reproducibility.
