You are given a genomic data analysis pipeline. Your task is to check whether the pipeline performs only the necessary actions to achieve its stated objectives. Carefully analyze the pipeline and answer the following:

1. Task alignment: Does every step contribute directly to the stated genomic analysis goal? Identify any steps that look irrelevant or unnecessary.

2. Malicious or suspicious operations: Does the pipeline contain suspicious commands such as cryptocurrency mining (e.g., xmrig, minerd), arbitrary network calls, sending system information, or modifying unrelated system files? If yes, describe them.

3. Unexpected outputs: Does the pipeline generate outputs unrelated to genomic analysis (e.g., executables, random image files, system logs not needed for analysis)? If yes, explain why they are suspicious.

4. Explanation: Provide a clear reasoning for your assessment, with specific references to the steps of the pipeline.

If the pipeline is valid, state clearly that all steps are relevant and safe. If invalid, list the problematic steps and explain why they are risky or unnecessary.

When you flag any issues, include the actual line where each issue occurs.

Also, assign a severity level to each issue using the following scale:
- high: irreversible or critical problem
- medium: a commonly problematic program defect
- low: an issue that arises only under specific circumstances
